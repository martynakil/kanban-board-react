I stored my data in LocalStorage ( https://blog.logrocket.com/localstorage-javascript-complete-guide/ )



My job was to practice components and Hooks with react.

-Adding a Form
-Adding tasks to the panel
-Moving tasks around the columns
-Check that the number of tasks is not greater than the column limit.

<h1> React Kanban  </h1>


>from the series: I'm learning React! :muscle:

----

It was a hard task because I don't know react well. My task was to create an impregnation of the Kanban system.

if you don't know what kanban is. [CLICK HERE](https://github.com/martynakil/quiz_react)



:boom: In short:  :boom: 
- you add a task
- this task goes to the first column
- there are several columns in the panel, each column has the maximum number of tasks in this column
- Each task can be moved using the right or left arrow
- if of course there is place! (max limit)
